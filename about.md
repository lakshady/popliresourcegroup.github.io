<br>

Originally from India, settled in Singapore for the last few years. Formally educated in design, painting came naturally to me.
<br>
Being married to a sailor, I traveled the world imbibing diverse art influences, mainly folk art.
<br>
Almost all native art has its roots in humanityâ€™s attempt at understanding the mysticism of life and reflecting the ancient beliefs and values of its people.
<br>
For me too my paintings originate from a certain introspective thought, which subsequently unfold as an array of colours on different mediums.
<br>
I try to bring out the balance of life which is beyond the community, and cultural diversity, in a vivid play of colours.
